# OOSD LAB 1: Weeks 3-6

This assessment is _individual_. You are not allowed to publish your assignment, copy the repository, share the solution with teammates, or anything of the like. Refer to the standard warning in Canvas.



## Introduction
This assessment evaluates the following CLOs

- CLO3: Apply the UML design notation as part of the OO development process.
- CLO5: Apply the process of Refactoring to continuously improve a software product.
- CLO6: Apply Design by Contract to produce robust self-verifying software modules.


The following topics are assessed:

- Week 3: Refactoring (Practical)
- Week 4: Design by Contract
- Week 6: Creational Patterns


Acknowledged words, data, diagrams, models, frameworks and/or ideas of others you have quoted (i.e. directly copied), summarised, paraphrased, discussed or mentioned in your assessment through the appropriate and consistent referencing methods.

Please read all detailed requirements on Canvas and ensure your assignment satisfies all of them. In addition, you cannot use examples mentioned in lecture slides and workshop instructions in your answer(s).



## Assignment Activities [MANDATORY]

### Task 1: src/main/java/task1 (10 marks)

The `StudentEnrol` class is designed to manage the enrolment of students. Students are allowed to take up to seven courses made up of cores and electives selected from the list of cores (`coresOffered`) and electives (`electivesOffered`). There is an additional constraint that the number of electives enrolled by a student must be no more than half of core courses this student enrolled at any time.  

You are required to:
 
 **1.1.** Write the pre and post-conditions (if applicable) for all methods except `display()`
 
 **1.2.** Write the the class invariants. 
 
 **1.3.** Specify invariants, preconditions and post-conditions as comments using the Javdoc annotations `@invariant`, `@pre.condition` and `@post.condition` respectively (in the spaces provided). You may use the notation `OLD.cores` in the post-conditions to refer to the original value for cores.    

Please note that duplicate conditions will cause 0 mark for the corresponding part.



### Task 2: src/main/java/task2 (15 marks)

You are required to:

**2.1.** In the code located on `src/main/java/task2` the classes have a number of common features. You are required to apply _extract superclass_ refactoring and write the resulting code. You may use protected instance variables if suitable. Complement your answer with a Class Diagram. You _must_ add it to the Answer file using markdown. Save it inside the `task2` folder.

**2.2.** In the same folder, there is a `Answers.md` file. Write in that file the answers to the following questions:

  * 2.2.A: Name at least 3 smells that you identified BEFORE making the change of point 2.1, and provide your reasons. Is there any specific smell that is solved with the extract superclass? _No less than 350 words_.
  
  * 2.2.B: Mention other refactorings that you did when you _extracted the superclass_. Were these refactorings needed for the _extract superclass_? Why? Could you have used _extract interface_ instead? _No less than 250 words_.




### Task 3: src/main/java/task3 (10 marks)

Write your answers to the following questions in `task3/Answers.md`:

**3.1.** What creational pattern is being used in `CloudServer`? Is it correctly implemented? Why or Why not? Could you implement it differently? Justify accordingly with sufficient explanations. 

**3.2.** Not all Builders must construct visual objects. What might you use a Builder to construct? Why? Find a real-world example and explain why it is correct using it there. Your answer should have at least 500 words _without_ the code snippet.

**3.3.** If you are writing a program to track investments (namely: stocks, bonds, metal futures) in multiple countries (namely: Australia, US, UK), how might you use an _abstract factory_? Why? Complement your answer with a Class Diagram. You _must_ add it to the Answer file using markdown. Save it inside the `task3` folder.
